# Keras_Univariate_Forecasting_LSTM
Univariate Forecasting Using Keras In Python


Disclaimer: This code snippet is developed with an intension for generic use only. I hereby declare that the code was not part of any of my professional development work. Also, no sensitive or confidential data sources are used for this development.

Description: The repository consists of LSTM model for Uni-variate forecasting using Keras module in Python.

Note:

1. User Input Section allows set all model parameters as well as data source specification. Users dont need to edit anything except this section. This is a fully automated end to end code
2. It is assumed that input data source is a cleaned i.e. free from outlier. However the script can handle missing values by imputing with latest avaiable records 
3. Only test sample model evaluation metrices are reported

Compatibility: The code is developed and tested on Jupyter and Spyder Notebook using Python 3.7
